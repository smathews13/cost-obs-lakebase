---

A full-stack Databricks App for account-level compute cost visibility, chargeback, and anomaly detection across your entire Databricks platform.

Built on FastAPI + React, deployed as a [Databricks App](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/databricks-apps/index.html) with OAuth authentication and serverless compute built in. Supports **multi-cloud deployment** across AWS and Azure with automatic cloud detection.

---

## Deployment

### Prerequisites

Before deploying, confirm the following are in place:

| Requirement | Why |
|---|---|
| **A running Serverless Pro SQL Warehouse** | **Required before deploying.** The app cannot create a warehouse on your behalf (the service principal lacks that permission by default). Create one in **SQL → SQL Warehouses → Create Warehouse** before running the setup wizard. |
| **Workspace Admin** (at minimum) | Required to grant the app's service principal `SELECT` on system tables |
| **Unity Catalog enabled** | All billing data is in `system.*` tables under UC — the app will not function without it |
| **System tables enabled** | Contact your Databricks account team if `system.billing.usage` is not accessible in your workspace |
| **Databricks Apps enabled** | Available on Premium plan and above |
| **Deploy from Git preview** *(recommended)* | Enables deploying directly from this GitHub repo — no file uploads needed. Enable in **Settings → Workspace Previews → "Deploy Databricks apps from Git repositories (Beta)"** — see [Deploy from Git](#1-deploy-from-git-beta) below. |
| **User authorization preview + `sql` scope** *(recommended)* | Runs queries as the logged-in user instead of the service principal — system table access is automatic for workspace admins. See [Authenticate as User](#2-authenticate-as-user-user-authorization) below. |
| **Account Tables (`system.billing.account_prices`)** *(optional)* | Unlocks the Account Prices toggle for negotiated pricing. Private preview — contact your Databricks account team. See [Account Tables](#3-account-tables-private-preview) below. |

> The setup wizard will show all available warehouses in a picker. In rare cases (typically Azure) where no warehouses appear, it will display the exact `GRANT USE ON WAREHOUSE` statement to run as a workspace admin.

### Deploy from Git

Deploy directly from this repository using Databricks Apps' built-in Git integration. No local clone or file sync required.

> **Enable the Deploy from Git preview first**
> If you don't see a **Git repository** option when creating an app, you need to enable the beta feature in your workspace:
> 1. Sign in as a workspace admin
> 2. Go to **Settings → Workspace Previews** (see [Databricks docs](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/admin/workspace-settings/manage-previews#-manage-workspace-level-previews) for navigation steps)
> 3. Find **"Deploy Databricks apps from Git repositories (Beta)"** under the Databricks Apps section
> 4. Toggle it **ON** and save

#### Step 1 — Create the app

1. In your Databricks workspace, go to **Apps → Create App**
2. Choose **Git repository** as the source
3. Enter the repo URL: `https://github.com/smathews13/cost-obs-databricks`
4. Give the app a name and click **Create**

#### Step 2 — Deploy

1. Once the app is created, click **Deploy**
2. Set the git reference:
   - **Branch:** `main`
   - **Reference type:** `Branch`
   - **Source code path:** leave empty
3. Click **Deploy** — no environment variables required

Or click the **Deploy to Databricks** button at the top of this README.

### Environment Variables

**No environment variables are required to deploy.** Databricks Apps injects OAuth credentials and the workspace host automatically.

<details>
<summary>Optional environment variable overrides</summary>

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABRICKS_HOST` | Auto-detected | Override the workspace URL if not picked up automatically |
| `DATABRICKS_HTTP_PATH` | Auto-created | Point to an existing warehouse, or omit to auto-create one |
| `COST_OBS_CATALOG` | `main` | Unity Catalog catalog for materialized views |
| `COST_OBS_SCHEMA` | `cost_obs` | Schema name for materialized views |
| `GENIE_SPACE_ID` | — | Genie Space ID for AI cost chat |
| `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | — | Azure subscription ID (shown in account banner on Azure) |
| `SMTP_HOST` / `SMTP_*` | — | Email alert configuration |
| `ENDPOINT_NAME` + `PGHOST` | — | Lakebase connection (falls back to Delta tables if not set) |
| `AWS_COST_CATALOG` / `AWS_COST_SCHEMA` | `billing` / `aws` | AWS CUR actual cost tables |
| `AZURE_COST_CATALOG` / `AZURE_COST_SCHEMA` | `billing` / `azure` | Azure cost export tables |
| `DATABRICKS_TOKEN` | — | Only needed for **local development** — the setup wizard can generate one for you |

</details>

### First-Run Setup Wizard

On first deploy, the app detects that materialized views haven't been created yet and launches a 3-step setup wizard. The dashboard does not render until setup is complete.

#### Step 1 — Environment

Confirms your workspace host, cloud provider (AWS/Azure/GCP), authenticated identity, catalog, and schema.

**SQL Warehouse:** The recommended setup is to add a `sql-warehouse` resource in your app configuration (Apps UI → Configure → Add resource → SQL warehouse) and set it to `CAN USE`. The app reads the warehouse from this resource automatically — no environment variables needed.

If no warehouse resource is configured, this step shows a searchable list of existing warehouses to select from, plus an option to create a new serverless Pro warehouse. If no warehouses are visible at all, the app displays the exact `GRANT` statement to run as a workspace admin:

```sql
GRANT USE ON WAREHOUSE <warehouse-name> TO `<app-service-principal>`;
```

#### Step 2 — Permissions

Checks access to the required system tables. On first deploy, the app automatically attempts to grant the necessary permissions to the service principal and (when the `sql` scope is configured) to the authenticated user.

If any permissions are still missing after the auto-grant, the wizard shows the exact statements to run:

```sql
GRANT USE CATALOG ON CATALOG system TO `<service-principal>`;
GRANT USE SCHEMA ON SCHEMA system.billing TO `<service-principal>`;
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE system.billing.usage TO `<service-principal>`;
-- (plus any others shown as missing)
```

Click **Re-check** after running any manual grants to confirm before proceeding.

#### Step 3 — Create Tables

Creates 6 pre-aggregated Delta tables from your billing history. This typically takes 2–5 minutes depending on data volume. Progress is shown in real time.

#### Complete

Click **Go to Dashboard**. The user who completes setup is automatically added as an app admin.

The wizard can be re-launched at any time from **Settings → Re-run Setup Wizard**.

## Databricks Preview Features

The following workspace previews unlock additional functionality in this app. Enable any that are available in your workspace — the app gracefully falls back when a preview is not enabled. All are enabled per workspace by a workspace admin via **Settings → Workspace Previews**.

### 1. Deploy from Git (Beta)

Enables deploying this app directly from GitHub — no file uploads or local tooling required. This is the recommended deployment path.

**To enable:**

1. Sign in as a workspace admin
2. Go to **Settings → Workspace Previews**
3. Find **"Deploy Databricks apps from Git repositories (Beta)"** and toggle it **ON**

Once enabled, go to **Apps → Create App** and choose **Git repository** as the source. Enter `https://github.com/smathews13/cost-obs-databricks` and deploy from the `main` branch.

### 2. Authenticate as User (User Authorization)

When enabled, the app runs SQL queries as the logged-in user's identity rather than the shared app service principal. Benefits:

- System table queries respect each user's individual permissions
- Audit logs show the real user, not the service principal
- Workspace admins get system table access automatically — no manual GRANTs needed for them
- The app automatically grants required permissions to the SP on startup for non-admin users

**To enable:**

1. Sign in as a workspace admin
2. Go to **Settings → Workspace Previews**
3. Find **"User authorization for Databricks Apps"** and toggle it **ON**
4. In your app configuration (Apps UI), go to **Configure → Add scope → `sql`**

When the `sql` scope is configured, the app automatically uses user authentication for all SQL queries. If the scope is not configured, it falls back to the service principal seamlessly.

### 3. Account Tables (Private Preview)

Enables the **Account Prices** toggle in the DBU Overview tab. When toggled on, the app reads from `system.billing.account_prices` to show your negotiated/discounted prices instead of standard list prices.

This system table is a private preview. Contact your Databricks account team to request access. When available, the app automatically grants the required permissions on startup — no manual `GRANT` statements needed.

```

### Data Sources

All billing and compute data is **account-level** — queries run against Unity Catalog system tables which span all workspaces in the account.

| System Table | Usage |
|---|---|
| `system.billing.usage` | Core spend/DBU data for all products |
| `system.billing.list_prices` | Standard SKU pricing for cost calculation |
| `system.billing.account_prices` | Negotiated/discounted account-specific prices (private preview) |
| `system.query.history` | SQL query attribution, source tracking, and rightsizing signals |
| `system.compute.clusters` | Cluster metadata, names, owners, ML runtime detection |
| `system.compute.warehouses` | Warehouse names, types, sizes |
| `system.lakeflow.pipelines` | SDP pipeline name resolution |
| `system.lakeflow.jobs` | Job name resolution |
| `system.lakeflow.job_run_timeline` | Job success/failure tracking for KPIs |
| `system.serving.served_entities` | ML endpoint metadata |
| `system.access.workspaces_latest` | Workspace name resolution |

### Materialized Views

The setup wizard creates **6 pre-aggregated Delta tables** in your Unity Catalog (`main.cost_obs` by default). These are the only persistent objects the app creates in your environment.

| Table | What it stores | Rows (est.) |
|---|---|---|
| `daily_usage_summary` | Total DBUs + spend per day | ~365 |
| `daily_product_breakdown` | DBUs + spend per day × product category (SQL, ETL, Interactive, etc.) | ~3,600 |
| `daily_workspace_breakdown` | DBUs + spend per day × workspace | ~3,600–36,000 |
| `sql_tool_attribution` | Genie vs DBSQL spend split per day × warehouse | ~730–7,000 |
| `daily_query_stats` | Query count, rows read, compute time per day | ~365 |
| `dbsql_cost_per_query` | Per-query cost attribution for the last 90 days | ~90k–900k |

### Keeping Tables Fresh

**Tables must be refreshed manually** — there is no automated nightly job. Refresh whenever you want to pull in the latest billing data (recommended: once a day or before sharing reports with stakeholders).

To refresh: go to **Settings → Tables & Storage → Refresh**. This rebuilds all 6 tables from the latest `system.*` data. The refresh runs in the background and typically takes 2–5 minutes depending on data volume and warehouse warmup. Progress is shown in real time.

Tables can be dropped and recreated at any time with no data loss — all source data lives in `system.*` tables managed by Databricks.

### Performance Optimizations

| Optimization | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Materialized Views** | Pre-aggregated Delta tables for sub-second dashboard loads |
| **Parallel Query Execution** | `ThreadPoolExecutor` (10 workers) runs 6–8 queries concurrently per bundle endpoint |
| **4-Hour Query Cache** | `TTLCache` with 500 entries — cost data changes at most once per day |
| **SDK Call Caching** | Pipeline names, group membership, and app registry cached for 1 hour |
| **Bundle Endpoints** | Single API call returns all data for a tab (reduces HTTP round-trips) |
| **React Query** | 30-minute stale time, 1-hour GC — prevents redundant refetches |
| **Lazy-Loaded Chunks** | Each heavy tab (Cloud Costs, AI/ML, Tagging, etc.) is a separate JS chunk loaded on first visit |

source .venv/bin/activate
DATABRICKS_HOST=https://your-workspace.cloud.databricks.com \
DATABRICKS_TOKEN=dapi... \
DATABRICKS_HTTP_PATH=/sql/1.0/warehouses/your-id \
COST_OBS_CATALOG=main \
uvicorn server.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload

# Frontend (port 5173, separate terminal)
cd client && bun run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173

---

## Cloud Cost Integration

The Cloud Costs tab displays estimated infrastructure costs out of the box. It can also show **actual** AWS or Azure billing data when configured. Full step-by-step setup instructions for both clouds are built into the app — open the Cloud Costs tab and click **Set Up Actual Costs** to launch the in-app wizard.

### AWS (CUR 2.0)

The app reads from `billing.aws.actuals_gold`. Setup steps are available in the in-app wizard, and the table location can be overridden via `AWS_COST_CATALOG` / `AWS_COST_SCHEMA`.

### Azure (Cost Management Export)

The app reads from `billing.azure.actuals_gold`. Setup steps are available in the in-app wizard, and the table location can be overridden via `AZURE_COST_CATALOG` / `AZURE_COST_SCHEMA`.

---

## App Observability

Databricks Apps has built-in [OpenTelemetry-based observability](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/databricks-apps/observability) that automatically captures traces, logs, and metrics into Unity Catalog tables:

| UC Table | Contents |
|---|---|
| `otel_metrics` | Request counts, latency histograms, error rates |
| `otel_spans` | Distributed traces for API requests end-to-end |
| `otel_logs` | App log output with trace correlation |

All telemetry is queryable via SQL in your workspace.

---

## Security

- All dashboard API endpoints are authenticated via Databricks OAuth (handled by the Databricks Apps platform)
- The `X-Forwarded-Email` header is used to identify the requesting user
- Settings mutation endpoints (cloud connections, webhook config, user permissions) require **admin role** — enforced server-side before any state change
- Webhook URLs are masked in API responses (never returned in plaintext after save)
